# Statics

C++ header only library inspired by the book **Engineering Mechanics STATICS** by R. C. Hibbeler.
This repository is created for self-learning purposes.

## Compilation
Windows (Mac and Ubuntu would work similarly -> there are no dependencies):

```bash
cd C:\brg\2_code\statics
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
cmake --build . --config Release
.\Release\MyProject.exe
```

## It started from wanting to learn about the Moments, and gradually learn more...
