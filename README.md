# Statics

C++ header only library inspired by the book **Engineering Mechanics STATICS** by R. C. Hibbeler.

This repository is created for self-learning purposes, by always being annoyed of not knowing even a little bit of Statics...

## Compilation

```bash
cd C:\brg\2_code\statics
mkdir build

**Mac, Ubuntu** 
```bash

## It started from wanting to learn the Moments, and gradually learn more...
